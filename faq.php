							The expiration date is the final day that the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and 								safety of a medication. Drug expiration dates exist on most medication labels, including 								prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) and dietary (herbal) supplements. U.S. pharmaceutical 								manufacturers are required by law to place expiration dates on prescription products prior to 								marketing.

							For legal and liability reasons, manufacturers will not make recommendations about the 								stability of drugs past the original expiration date. However, for most drugs, it's just an 								arbitrary date, usually 1 to 5 years out, that the manufacturer selects to test drug 								stability. Once the container of medication is opened after production, that expiration date 								is no longer guaranteed.

							Although generic drug active ingredients are chemically identical to their branded 								counterparts, they are typically sold at a cheaper price than the brand name drug.

							Generics are less expensive because the drug manufacturer does not have to duplicate the 								original clinical trials for effectiveness and safety, which lowers the cost to bring the drug 								to market. Generics are not less expensive because they are lower in quality.

							Pill Splitting - Is it Safe?

								Pills or tablets that are scored with a line or indentation down the middle are usually okay to split in half. Not all strengths or formulations of the same medicine may be scored. Coated pills or tablets that are slowly released in your body should not be cut. 

You should only split one pill at a time and use up both halves before splitting another pill. Do not split all your tabs at once.
Capsules should not be split, crushed or opened unless recommended by your healthcare provider.
Even if your pill is scored, check with your pharmacist first to be sure you can safely cut it in half before you take it. If you change manufacturers or strengths of medicine, check again before you split it.

Pills with special coating (for example, enteric-coated pills) or that are released into the body in a certain way, like extended-release (ER), sustained-release (SR) or long-acting (LA) medicines should typically not be split, cut, crushed or chewed. This can alter the release characteristics and how fast it is absorbed into your body, which may cause a dangerous overdose in some cases.

Capsules should not be split, crushed or opened unless your healthcare provider has told you it’s ok; for example, that you can open it and sprinkle on food (such as applesauce) to make it easier to swallow.

Tablet splitting should always be done under the direction of your healthcare provider. Check with your doctor or pharmacist first to make sure splitting your pill is a safe and economical choice for you.

								if your pill or tablet is “scored”, this usually means you can split your tablet in half. A “score” is a line or indentation that is found down the middle of the tablet that allows for easier cutting. 

You can see a few example of a tablet “score” here:<br>

Splitting your pill in half and taking only one-half will change the dose of your medicine. Only do this if your healthcare provider has directed you to do this.

Ultimately, the uniformity of the active ingredient in your pills will depend upon the standards of quality assurance set at the particular drug manufacturing facility.
