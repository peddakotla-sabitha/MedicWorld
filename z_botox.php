				<h2>What is Botox?</h2><br><br>
					Botox injection is a prescription medicine that helps improve the appearance of facial wrinkles, and treats 						some medical conditions, by causing muscles to relax, as botox blocks nerve signals to the muscles.<br><br>

					Botox Cosmetic and Botox injections are both FDA-approved medicines,  Botox Cosmetic is used to soften facial 						wrinkles, and Botox injections are used to treat medical conditions like chronic migraines, specific bladder 						issues, excessive sweating, and other muscle-related medical conditions.<br><br>

					The difference between Botox and Botox Cosmetic is they are different strengths once the vial has been made 						up, and they have different FDA-approved uses. Therefore they should not be used interchangeably.<br><br>

					Botox and Botox Cosmetic contain onabotulinumtoxinA, which is one of the botulinum toxins from the class of 						medicines called neurotoxins<br><br>.

					Other botulinum toxins FDA approved medicines are abobotulinumtoxina (Dysport),  incobotulinumtoxina (Xeomin), 						daxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm (Daxxify), prabotulinumtoxina (Jeuveau) and rimabotulinumtoxinb (Myobloc).<br><br>

					<h3>What are Botox Cosmetic and Botox used for?</h3><br><br>
					Botox Cosmetic is used for:<br>

					<b>Facial wrinkles</b>. Botox Cosmetic is used (FDA approved) to help smooth facial wrinkles, specifically  						moderate to severe forehead lines, crowâ€™s feet lines (wrinkles near the outer corner of the eye), and frown l 						lines between the eyebrows in adults.<br><br>
					Botox is used for:<br>

					Chronic Migraine. Botox is used to prevent chronic migraines in adult patients who have 15 or more headaches a 						month that last for 4 hours a day or longer. For migraines, botox can be injected into seven specific areas of 						the head and neck muscles. Results usually last up to 12 weeks, depending on the individual patient. Botox has 						not been established as safe or effective for the prevention of episodic migraine (14 headache days or fewer 						per month) in seven placebo-controlled studies.<br><br>
					Cervical dystonia. Botox is used in patients 16 years and older to treat cervical dystonia, which is a 						condition that causes your neck muscles to contract abnormally. This makes your neck twist and causes your 						head to tilt to one side, forward, or backward.<br><br>
					Muscle stiffness: Botox is also used to treat muscle stiffness (spasticity) of the arms, hands, legs, and feet 						in adults and children who are at least 2 years old. Spasticity is when there is an abnormal increase in 						muscle tone or stiffness of muscle, which can cause problems with movement and speech, or can cause discomfort 						or pain.<br><br>
					Eye muscle conditions. Botox is used to treat specific eye muscle conditions caused by nerve disorders in 						adults and children who are at least 12 years old. This includes uncontrolled blinking or spasm of the eyelids 						(benign essential blepharospasm), and a condition in which the eyes do not point in the same direction 						(strabismus).<br><br>
					Bladder issues. Botox is used in adults to treat overactive bladder and urinary incontinence (urine leakage) 						that has not been helped by other medication. Botox may be used to treat incontinence caused by nerve 						disorders such as spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis. Botox is also used to treat the neurologic 						condition neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in pediatric patients 5 years of age and older. Botox is only 						used for bladder issues when patients have an inadequate response or are intolerant to an anticholinergic 						medication.<br><br>
					Excessive sweating. Botox is also used to treat severe underarm sweating (primary axillary hyperhidrosis) in 						adults.<br><br>


					<h3>Warnings</h3><br><br>
					You should not use Botox if you have an infection in the area where the medicine will be injected. This 					medicine should not be used to treat overactive bladder or incontinence if you have a current bladder 						infection or if you are unable to urinate (unless you routinely use a catheter).<br><br>

					The botulinum toxin contained in Botox can spread to other body areas beyond where it was injected. This can 						cause serious life-threatening side effects.<br><br>

					Call your doctor at once if you have a hoarse voice, drooping eyelids, vision problems, severe eye irritation, 						severe muscle weakness, loss of bladder control, or trouble breathing, talking, or swallowing.<br><br>
		
					<h3>How is Botox given?</h3><br><br>
					Botox injections should be given only by a trained medical professional, which includes when used for cosmetic 						purposes.<br><br>

					This medicine is injected into a muscle by a healthcare provider. How often you have Botox injections depends 						on the condition being treated, Botox Cosmetic injections for temporary improvement in the appearance of 						facial lines should be spaced at least 3 months apart, and for treatment for other conditions, it may be up to 						at least 12 weeks between injections.<br><br>

					The effects of a Botox injection are temporary and your symptoms may return completely within 3 months. After 						repeat injections, it may take less and less time between injections before your symptoms return, especially 						if your body develops antibodies to the botulinum toxin.<br><br>

					You should not seek to have botulinum toxin injections from more than one medical professional at a time. If 						you do switch healthcare providers, it is important to tell your new provider how long it has been since your 						last botulinum toxin injection.<br><br>

					Using this medication more often than prescribed will not make it more effective and may result in serious 						side effects.<br><br>

					Cosmetic use. Botox Cosmetic starts working or showing its effect usually in the first 1 to 4 days, with the 						maximum effect being reached in the first 1 to 4 weeks. The cosmetic effect usually lasts for 3 to 4 months 						but varies depending on each different individual.<br><br>

					Chronic migraine prevention. Injections should be given in 7 specific head/neck muscle sites, with the 						recommended re-treatment schedule every 12 weeks.<br><br>

					Eye conditions. When receiving injections for eye muscle conditions, you may need to use eye drops, ointment, 						a special contact lens or other device to protect the surface of your eye. It is important to follow your 						doctor's instructions. For eye muscle spasms it may take only 1 to 3 days after injection before spasm 						symptoms begin to improve. You may notice the greatest improvement after 2 to 6 weeks.<br><br>

					Excessive sweating. If you are being treated for excessive underarm sweating, you should shave your underarms 						about 24 hours before your injection. You should not apply antiperspirant or deodorant for 24 hours before or 						after you receive the injection. Avoid exercise and hot foods or beverages within 30 minutes before the 					injection.<br><br>
	
					Neck muscle spasm. It may take up to 2 weeks after injection before neck muscle spasm symptoms begin to 					improve. You may notice the greatest improvement after 6 weeks.<br><br>

					Adult bladder dysfunction. Before treatment, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics for you to take for 1-3 						days before your treatment, on the day of your treatment, and for 1 to 3 days after your treatment.<br><br>

					For more detailed instructions (with pictures) about dilution, resulting strengths, how to use and where to 						inject Botox Cosmetic or Botox, read the "Dosage and Administration" on the Professional Botox Cosmetic 					document  or Professional Botox document<br><br>
